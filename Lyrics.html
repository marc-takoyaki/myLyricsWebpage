Oh, ey
You don't know, babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are</p>
<h1><b><u>[Verse 2]</u></b></h1> 

<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB; color:white">

You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh</p>

<h1><b><u>[Verse 4]</u></b></h1> 
<p style="font-family:Berlin Sans FB; color:white">
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh
You're the best part, oh oh oh
Best part. </p>

Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
